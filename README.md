# 🎓 CS50 Solutions by Rafsan

Welcome to my curated repository of solutions for Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) — Introduction to Computer Science. This repo documents my journey through the course, with clean, well-commented code and assignment-style clarity for each problem set.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder corresponds to a CS50 problem set or lab, organized by week and topic:


Each solution includes:
- ✅ Clean code with inline comments
- 🧠 Foundational logic breakdown
- 🛠️ Platform-specific setup notes (MinGW, VS Code tasks, etc.)
- 📚 References to official specs and walkthroughs

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- To help peers debug and understand CS50 challenges
- To document my growth as a CSE student at SUB
- To build a foundation for future projects and interviews

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run Locally

Most C solutions are built for GCC via MinGW. You can compile using:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
